            everything in this structure is not considered part of any content
            of your webpage

            Most tag elements in html are done in pairs

            These are called opening and closing pairs

            There are some tags that are not in pairs and are refered to
            as empty tags (aka void)

            The opening tag indecates the start of your element
            and the closing tag indicates the end of your element

            The closing tag has the same name as the opening tag plus
            a slash preceeding the name


            The head area of your webpage is not considered content

            The tags within the head area are used by the browser to
            manage some display of the page, give additional documentation
            to the page, indicate charactersets, help with search engines,
            and many other assists

      <h3>Paragraph Tag</h3>
    <!--
        This is the coding block for your content in a paragraph
        The paragraph tag belongs to the "Block" group of tags
        A "block" group tag places yout content on a new line

        You can place all your paragraph text content on one physical
        line, however, that would require a lot of scrolling right and left
        You can have woed wrap active in your editor and it will NOT affect
        how the browser dispalys your paragraph content
        You can place your content on seperate lines yourself and it will NOT 
        affect how the browser displays your paragraph content
    -->
      <p>The paragraph tag is a block tag. A block tag begins a new line when
        the content is displayed by your browser. The browser does not display 
        your content in the physical style of how you gave entered your code in
        your Html file.
      </p>

        the go live update the browser display of my saved changes to the file?
